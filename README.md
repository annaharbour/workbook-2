Strings, Classes, Loops, and Arrays

# Java Workbook 2

**Java Workbook 2** ‚Äì Java exercises designed to strengthen the essential programming hallmarks **Strings**, 
**Classes**, **Loops**, and 
**Arrays**. 
## üß† Topics Covered

This workbook includes exercises which reinforce the following Java concepts:

### üìå Strings
- **Working with Strings**: Creating, concatenating, and formatting strings.
- **Comparing Strings**: Using `equals()`, `equalsIgnoreCase()`, `compareTo()` vs `==`.
- **String Methods**: `substring()`, `indexOf()`, `length()`, `replace()`, `toUpperCase()`, etc.
- **Converting Strings**: Parsing strings to numbers (`Integer.parseInt()`, `Double.parseDouble()`), and vice versa.
- **Dates**: Introduction to `LocalDate`, `LocalDateTime`, and formatting with `DateTimeFormatter`.
- **StringBuilder**: Efficiently building and modifying strings with `StringBuilder`.

### üß± Classes & Objects
- **Classes**: Defining custom data types with fields and methods.
- **Objects**: Creating instances and calling methods on them.
- **Access Modifiers**: Understanding `public`, `private`, and `protected` in encapsulation.
- **Other Methods**: Utility methods, instance vs static methods, `toString()`, and `equals()`.
- **Overloading Methods**: Using the same method name with different parameters.

### üîÅ Loops
- **while, do-while, and for loops**: Iterating over tasks based on conditions and counters.
- **break vs continue**: Controlling loop execution with flow statements.

### üî¢ Arrays
- **Array Basics**: Declaring, initializing, and accessing elements.
- **for-each Loops**: Simplified iteration over arrays.
- **Passing Arrays to Methods**: Sending entire arrays to functions for processing.
- **Returning Arrays from Methods**: How to construct and return arrays.
- **Sorting Arrays**: Using built-in sorting (e.g., `Arrays.sort()`) and custom sort logic.
- **Copying Arrays**: Deep copies vs shallow copies, using `Arrays.copyOf()` and loops.
- **Other Array Methods**: `Arrays.toString()`, `Arrays.equals()`, `Arrays.fill()`, etc.

## üìÇ Project Layout

Each folder in this repository contains a Java project or mini-exercise that focuses on applying the above concepts in real-world scenarios like:

- Address building
- Car inventory management
- Cell phone plan suggestion
- Name generation and parsing
- Game scoring logic
- Dice rolling simulation
- Palindrome finding
- Theater seat reservation
- And more!

## üöÄ Getting Started

Prerequisites:

Java JDK 8 or higher
Maven
Git

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/workbook-2.git

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
    mvn clean install

2. From your IDE, run each project individually using its main method, which acts as the entry point.
