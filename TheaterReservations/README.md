# Theater Reservation Application

This application is used to allow customers to reserve tickets for a specific date. Prompt the user for their full name, the date of the show, and the number of tickets they will need. Once the reservation is made, display a confirmation message to the customer in this format: ticket(s) reserved for (date) under (LastName, FirstName)

If only one ticket is reserved, the confirmation should not include an "s"
